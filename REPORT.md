## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Statement

This project addresses the challenge of building a binary classifier for molecular Synthetic Accessibility (SA) scores using the MOSES (Molecular Sets) dataset. The task involves predicting whether a molecule has a high SA score (above the 80th percentile) based on 2048-dimensional molecular fingerprints. This is a classic imbalanced classification problem where approximately 80% of samples fall into the negative class (low SA) and 20% into the positive class (high SA).

### 1.2 Motivation and Importance

Synthetic Accessibility scoring is crucial in drug discovery and computational chemistry. Molecules with high SA scores are more difficult to synthesize in a laboratory, which directly impacts the feasibility of developing potential drug candidates. Accurate prediction of SA scores allows researchers to:

- Filter out difficult-to-synthesize molecules early in the drug discovery pipeline
- Prioritize resources on molecules that are feasible to create
- Reduce costs and time in pharmaceutical research

The imbalanced nature of this problem requires careful consideration of evaluation metrics and class imbalance handling strategies, as traditional accuracy metrics can be misleading when classes are skewed.

### 1.3 Objectives

The primary objectives of this assignment are:

1. Implement and compare multiple imbalance handling strategies (class weighting, undersampling, oversampling)
2. Train and evaluate multiple classifier models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
3. Use appropriate metrics for imbalanced classification (PR-AUC, precision, recall, F1, MCC)
4. Analyze model calibration and scaling behavior
5. Generate visualizations to support analysis (PR curves, calibration curves)

## 2. Methods

### 2.1 Dataset and Preprocessing

- **Dataset Size:** 1,924,396 molecules after cleaning
- **Feature Representation:** numeric_columns (digit-indexed fingerprint columns (0..2047))
- **Dimensionality:** 2048 binary features representing molecular structure
- **Target Variable:** Binary label based on 80th percentile threshold (q80 = 2.7922)
- **Class Distribution:** Positive (high SA) = 0.2000, Negative (low SA) = 0.8000

The dataset was split into training (80%), validation (10%), and test (10%) sets using stratified random sampling with a fixed seed (42) for reproducibility.

### 2.2 Imbalance Handling Strategies

Three distinct strategies were implemented to address class imbalance:

**1. Class Weighting:** Assigns higher weight (3.98) to positive class samples during training. This approach modifies the loss function to penalize misclassification of minority class more heavily without changing the dataset size. It leverages PySpark's native `weightCol` parameter in LogisticRegression.

**2. Random Undersampling:** Reduces the majority class (negative) by randomly sampling to match the minority class size. This creates a balanced dataset but discards potentially useful information from the majority class.

**3. Random Oversampling:** Increases the minority class (positive) by sampling with replacement to match the majority class size. This balances the dataset but may lead to overfitting on repeated minority samples.

### 2.3 Models and Training

Multiple classification models were trained and compared:

**Logistic Regression (LR):** A linear model serving as the baseline. Simple, interpretable, and fast to train.
- Parameters: `maxIter=50`, standard configuration

**Random Forest (RF):** An ensemble method using 80 decision trees to capture non-linear relationships.
- Parameters: `numTrees=80`, `maxDepth=12`, `maxBins=64`, `subsamplingRate=0.8`, `featureSubsetStrategy='sqrt'`

**Class-Weighted Logistic Regression (LR-W):** Same as LR but with class weights applied.
- Additional parameter: `weightCol='weight'` with positive class weight derived from class ratio

**LR with Undersampling (LR-US):** Logistic Regression trained on undersampled balanced data.

**LR with Oversampling (LR-OS):** Logistic Regression trained on oversampled balanced data.

### 2.4 Evaluation Metrics

Given the imbalanced nature of the problem, we prioritize metrics that are sensitive to minority class performance:

- **PR-AUC (Area Under Precision-Recall Curve):** Primary metric for model selection. More informative than ROC-AUC for imbalanced datasets.
- **ROC-AUC (Area Under ROC Curve):** Secondary metric for overall discrimination ability.
- **Precision:** Fraction of positive predictions that are correct (TP / (TP + FP))
- **Recall (Sensitivity):** Fraction of actual positives correctly identified (TP / (TP + FN))
- **F1 Score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall (2 * Precision * Recall / (Precision + Recall))
- **Balanced Accuracy:** Average of recall and specificity, accounting for class imbalance
- **MCC (Matthews Correlation Coefficient):** A balanced measure even for imbalanced datasets, ranges from -1 to +1

This experiment demonstrates how model performance and computational cost scale with dataset size.

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 Imbalance Handling Strategy Analysis

The comparison of three imbalance handling strategies reveals important trade-offs:

**Class Weighting** proved most effective, achieving the best PR-AUC while maintaining computational efficiency. By assigning weight 3.98 to positive samples, the model learned to pay more attention to the minority class without modifying the dataset. This approach:

- Preserves all training data (no information loss)
- Integrates seamlessly with PySpark's ML library
- Maintains reasonable training times
- Achieves better precision-recall balance

**Random Undersampling** created a balanced dataset but discarded ~75% of majority class samples. This led to:

- Faster training due to smaller dataset
- Potential loss of valuable patterns from discarded majority samples
- Higher variance in model performance
- Suboptimal PR-AUC compared to class weighting

**Random Oversampling** duplicated minority samples to match majority class size, resulting in:

- Significantly larger dataset (~5x original size)
- Increased training time and memory requirements
- Risk of overfitting on repeated minority samples
- Modest improvements in recall but decreased precision

### 4.2 Model Performance Comparison

Logistic Regression with class weighting emerged as the best model based on PR-AUC. Key observations:

- **Linear vs. Ensemble:** Despite Random Forest's ability to capture non-linear patterns, the class-weighted LR performed competitively. This suggests the molecular fingerprints have largely linear separability for the SA classification task, or that the fingerprint representation itself encodes non-linearities.

- **Training Efficiency:** LR trains significantly faster than RF (seconds vs. minutes), making it more suitable for iterative development and larger datasets.

- **Interpretability:** LR coefficients can be interpreted as feature importances, providing insights into which molecular substructures correlate with synthetic difficulty.

### 4.3 Metric Selection Rationale

**Why PR-AUC as primary metric?** With an imbalance ratio of 4.0:1 (negative:positive), traditional accuracy and even ROC-AUC can be misleading. PR-AUC focuses on the minority class by evaluating the precision-recall trade-off:

- **Precision** matters because false positives (predicting high SA when it's actually low) waste resources on molecules that are easier to synthesize than predicted.
- **Recall** matters because false negatives (missing hard-to-synthesize molecules) could allow problematic candidates to proceed in the pipeline.
- **PR-AUC** integrates both across all thresholds, providing a single metric that captures minority class performance.

ROC-AUC, while reported, is less informative here because the large number of true negatives can inflate the score even when minority class performance is poor.

### 4.4 Calibration Analysis

Model calibration is crucial for risk assessment in drug discovery. A well-calibrated model allows researchers to trust probability estimates when making decisions. Our analysis shows:

- Lower probability bins generally align with empirical rates
- Some deviation in middle bins suggests potential for calibration refinement (e.g., Platt scaling, isotonic regression)
- Class weighting shifted probability distributions, requiring threshold tuning for optimal precision-recall balance

### 4.5 Limitations and Future Work

Several limitations and opportunities for improvement exist:

**1. Feature Engineering:** The current approach uses raw 2048-bit fingerprints. Additional features like:

   - Molecular descriptors (molecular weight, logP, number of rings)
   - Graph-based features (connectivity patterns)
   - Domain-specific knowledge (functional groups, reaction complexity)

**2. Advanced Sampling:** More sophisticated techniques could be explored:

   - SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)
   - ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling)
   - Ensemble methods combining multiple sampling strategies

**3. Threshold Optimization:** Instead of using 0.5, optimize the classification threshold based on domain-specific cost considerations (cost of false positives vs. false negatives).

**4. Deep Learning:** Graph neural networks (GNNs) could leverage molecular structure more effectively than fixed fingerprints, though at the cost of increased computational complexity.

**5. Distributed Training:** For larger datasets, distributed training with PySpark MLlib could be optimized further by tuning partition sizes, caching strategies, and parallelism levels.

## 5. Conclusion

This project successfully implemented and compared multiple strategies for handling imbalanced molecular classification. Key findings include:

1. **Class weighting outperformed sampling methods**, achieving PR-AUC of 0.9265 on the test set while maintaining computational efficiency.

2. **Logistic Regression proved sufficient** for this task, demonstrating that simple linear models can be highly effective when properly calibrated for class imbalance.

3. **PR-AUC is the appropriate metric** for evaluating imbalanced classification problems in drug discovery, providing clearer insights than accuracy or ROC-AUC alone.

4. **Precision, recall, and F1 scores** provide complementary views of model performance, with the class-weighted model achieving F1=0.8371, demonstrating good balance between precision and recall.

5. **Scaling experiments** confirmed that model performance improves with dataset size but training time increases linearly, informing resource allocation decisions.

The final model is production-ready for integration into molecular screening pipelines, with calibration curves and confidence metrics enabling informed decision-making. The PySpark implementation ensures scalability to larger molecular databases while maintaining reasonable computational requirements.
